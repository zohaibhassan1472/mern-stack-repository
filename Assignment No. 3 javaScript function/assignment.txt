Assignment 3: JavaScript Functions

Objective:

Practice creating and using JavaScript functions to perform various tasks.

Instructions:

Write JavaScript code to create functions that perform the following tasks:

1. Greeting Function: Create a function greet(name) that takes a name as an argument and returns a personalized greeting message.
2. Calculator Function: Create a function calculateSum(a, b) that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.
3. Even or Odd Function: Create a function isEven(num) that takes a number as an argument and returns true if the number is even, and false otherwise.
4. String Repeater Function: Create a function repeatString(str, n) that takes a string and a number as arguments, and returns the string repeated n times.
5. Temperature Converter Function: Create a function convertCelsiusToFahrenheit(celsius) that takes a temperature in Celsius as an argument and returns the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit.
6. Age Calculator Function: Create a function calculateAge(birthYear) that takes a birth year as an argument and returns the person's age.
7. Random Number Generator Function: Create a function generateRandomNumber(min, max) that takes two numbers as arguments and returns a random number between min and max.
8. String Length Function: Create a function getStringLength(str) that takes a string as an argument and returns its length.
9. Array Sum Function: Create a function calculateArraySum(arr) that takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns their sum.
10. Vowel Counter Function: Create a function countVowels(str) that takes a string as an argument and returns the number of vowels in the string.

Requirements:

- Use function declarations (e.g., function greet(name) { ... })
- Use return statements to output the results
- Test each function with sample inputs

Deliverables:

- A single JavaScript file containing all the functions
- Test each function with sample inputs and log the results to the console

Grading criteria:

- Correctness and functionality of each function
- Code organization and readability
- Use of proper syntax and semantics

Tips:

- Use online resources such as MDN Web Docs or W3Schools for reference.
- Test your code thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.

I hope this updated assignment helps your students practice a variety of JavaScriptÂ functions!
