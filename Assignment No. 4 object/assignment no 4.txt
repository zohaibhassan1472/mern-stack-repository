Assignment No 4: Mastering Object, String, Numbers, and Array Methods in JavaScript

Objective:

To gain hands-on experience with various Object, String, Numbers, and Array methods in JavaScript, and to understand their applications in real-world scenarios.

Instructions:

Part 1: Object Methods

1. Create an object student with the following properties: name, age, grade, and subjects.
2. Use Object.keys() to get an array of the object's keys and log it to the console.
3. Use Object.values() to get an array of the object's values and log it to the console.
4. Use Object.entries() to get an array of the object's key-value pairs and log it to the console.
5. Use delete to remove the grade property from the object and log the updated object to the console.
6. Use Object.assign() to add a new property school to the object and log the updated object to the console.

Part 2: String Methods

1. Create a string quote with the value "Believe you can and you're halfway there.".
2. Use toUpperCase() to convert the string to uppercase and log it to the console.
3. Use toLowerCase() to convert the string to lowercase and log it to the console.
4. Use substring() to extract the substring "you can" and log it to the console.
5. Use indexOf() to find the index of the substring "you're" and log it to the console.
6. Use replace() to replace the substring "halfway" with "almost there" and log the updated string to the console.

Part 3: Number Methods

1. Create a number pi with the value 3.14159.
2. Use toFixed() to round the number to 2 decimal places and log it to the console.
3. Use toPrecision() to round the number to 4 significant figures and log it to the console.

Part 4: Array Methods

1. Create an array students with the following objects:
[
  { name: "John", age: 20, grade: 85 },
  { name: "Alice", age: 22, grade: 90 },
  { name: "Bob", age: 21, grade: 78 },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 20, grade: 92 },
  { name: "David", age: 22, grade: 88 }
]
2. Use forEach() to iterate over the array and log each student's name and grade to the console.
3. Use map() to create a new array with each student's grade increased by 5 and log it to the console.
4. Use filter() to create a new array with only the students who have a grade greater than 85 and log it to the console.
5. Use find() to find the first student who has a grade greater than 90 and log it to the console.
6. Use findIndex() to find the index of the first student who has a grade greater than 90 and log it to the console.
7. Use reduce() to calculate the average grade of all students and log it to the console.
8. Use some() to check if any student has a grade greater than 95 and log the result to the console.
9. Use every() to check if all students have a grade greater than 70 and log the result to the console.
10. Use includes() to check if the array includes a student with the name "Alice" and log the result to the console.
11. Use indexOf() to find the index of the student with the name "Bob" and log it to the console.

Deliverables:

- A JavaScript file with the above operations performed on the student, quote, pi, and students variables.
- Console.log the results of each operation to verify the output.

Grading criteria:

- Correctness of the code and output.
- Use of the required methods and syntax.
- Code organization and readability.
- Use of comments to explain the code.

Tips and Resources:

- Use the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation for reference.
- Use online resources such as W3Schools or Stack Overflow for troubleshooting.
- Practice coding regularly to improve your skills.

By completing this assignment, you will gain a deeper understanding of Object, String, Numbers, and Array methods in JavaScript and be able to apply them in real-world scenarios.
